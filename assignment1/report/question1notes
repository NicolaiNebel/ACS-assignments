actual idea
---

divide address space into pages

page_no = addr / page_size
offset = addr % page_size

maintain a map: page_no => (machine, machine_page_addr) # frequently read, used on read and write
                machine => list of pages # infrequently used, read on leave, updated on new page added

on access to addr not yet in map: assign the page to some machine

given machine and machine_page_addr: read(machine, machine_page_addr + offset)

on machine leave: grab all the pages it was assigned and copy them to other machines
on machine join: Add it to struture of machines with available memory, assign pages to it as needed
